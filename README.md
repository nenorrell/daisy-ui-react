# Daisy UI React components
Influenced by packages like [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)


Improving the experience of using DaisyUI & React together. The goal of this package is to supply easy to consume Daisy UI components.

## Currently in development
There's a long way to go. There's a very small selection of components at the moment and little to no documentation outside of the code itself. The build hasn't been published to NPM yet either, so it's still not modulized :)

## Development
_**Comands below require Docker**_

### Starting dev env
`make run`

### Testing
`make test`

or to skip the install step:

`make test-fast`
